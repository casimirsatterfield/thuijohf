The CATALYST software was instituted after the release of the Radeon 8500, as a marketing effort to match nVidia's universal Detonator driver packages. This release for all Radeon family products updates the AMD display driver to the latest version. This unified driver has been further enhanced to provide. It's actually kept asking me to update from 12.3 to 12.6 for a while (The catalyst updater) but when I click yes and it downloads, it won't install. So I manually go to the AMD website and download the newest driver myself. The newest one right now is 12.6. I downloaded it, installed it, but it didn't ask me to restart my computer or anything. I check again and it still shows that I have 12.3. In fact, Catalyst still asks me if I want to update.

I strongly believe that to understand how each type views the world, you look at the art they make and swear by.

Art is the greatest healer! Personally, I find INFPs are very intelligent and creative. Mathematical, creative and emotional intelligence is such a deadly combination. Did I mention.

I really don't want to install and uninstall a whole bunch
